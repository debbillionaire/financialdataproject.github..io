									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/plane.PNG" alt="" /></a>
									<p>This airline client got in contact with us because of their management inexperience in financial and data analytics despite the management strong operations background, 
										their systems are disparate and not connected, and most surprisingly, the airline could not pull specific 
										aircraft details, such as route and seating capacity, from a single report, but rather needed to open two or more files 
										and compare the information. With our expertize, we were able rectify their data collation,connection and data visualization challenges. We analyze their data system and 
										present key insights to drive the business growth and position in the industry. This was done using V-LOOKUP, Pivot tables and Pivot chat with some excel formulas and function. Our expertize improve the management's data extraction ability by 70%.

										<h2><a href="#">D'GORGEOUS VENTURES 5-YEAR FINANCIAL MODEL</a></h2>
									</header>
									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/dgorgeous logo.PNG" alt="" /></a>
									<p>D'gorgeous venture is a start-up company into buying and selling of shoes, wears and cosmetics. The management of D'gorgeous ventures have no roadmap to
										clarify their short-term and long-term financial goals,hence, they approached us for financial guidance. As a fiancial analyst expert, we adviced the company on the benefits of having a financial model
										which would outline revenue targets, cost structures, and profitability milestones, providing a clear roadmap for achieving financial success, in addition
										it would help the company in projecting revenues and expenses over five years,optimizing resource allocation. Hence, we prepared a 5-year financial model for D'gorgeous ventures, which as not
										only helped the company with their short and long-term financial goal but also helped the company in identifying and quantifying financial risks integral to business planning 
										through scenario analysis enabling  D'gorgeous Ventures to assess the impact of various market conditions and strategic decisions.
										thereby mitigating risks proactively.
